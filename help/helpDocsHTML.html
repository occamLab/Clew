            <h2>Current Version</h2>
            <p>Clew allows you to record routes using your phone that you can then navigate (either in the forward or reverse direction) at a later point in time. Clew can be used in situations where you want to immediately navigate back to your starting location (e.g., if you went somewhere with a sighted guide or if it is harder to navigate the reverse journey) or when you want to remember a route that you are learning so you can navigate it more confidently in the future.  Importantly, Clew does not use your phone's GPS, so it can be used indoors.</p>
            <p>The ability to save routes is a new feature for Clew.</p>
            <h2>Future Versions</h2>
            <p>We are working on a route sharing feature so that you can send routes to other users.</p>
