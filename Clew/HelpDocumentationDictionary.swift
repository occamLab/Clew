To record a route that you don't need to save, or if you only want to be able to save the route in the reverse direction, you can simply activate the record button and move along the route you'd like to record. If you want to be able to save the route so that you can receive automatic guidance along it at a later time, activate the create landmark button and follow the procedure for landmark creation and route pausing described later in this document.<h3>Properly positioning your phone when using Clew</h3><p>The app's motion estimates are based primarily on analyzing images from your phone's camera. The app will not work unless your phone's rear camera is capturing images of your environment. The app will not work if the phone is in your pocket or if any part of your body is blocking your phone's rear camera. We have found that the app works best when you hold the phone in portrait orientation with the rear camera facing directly ahead of you and the phone oriented vertically. Other orientations can work, but may result in diminished accuracy.</p></body></html>","stoppingARecording":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>When you've finished the route, you can use the stop button to stop the recording. If you recorded a landmark before starting the route, you will be prompted to provide a name for the route and save it for later use in the forward direction. If you would like to pause the route so you can navigate it later in the reverse direction (i.e., from your current location back to the start) activate the pause button.</p></body></html>","pausingARouteOrRecordingALandmark":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>The procedure for pausing the route and recording a landmark are the same. The key idea is that in order to reuse routes, your phone must be able to align its current position with a position from the recorded route. In some cases, Apple's ARKit will be able to automatically do this registration (for example, when the camera sees a distinctive visual feature that can be matched to the recording); however, in many situations this will not be possible.</p><p>In order to register your position in such cases you be able to place the phone in a position and orientation such that you can reliably return the phone to that same position and orientation when reusing a saved route. While it is not crucial that you position the phone in exactly the same place (although the more accurately you can do this, the better the app will work), you must be able to place the phone in the precisely the same orientation. To make it easy to return the phone to the same orientation, you should hold your phone flat with the screen facing up and press the top (short-edge) of your phone flush with a vertical surface (like a wall). More instructions are provided in the app when you activate the pause feature or the create landmark feature.</p></body></html>","resumingARoute":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>Assuming you paused your route, you can resume it by following the instructions provided by the app. The app will prompt you to return the phone to the location where you paused it or created a landmark.</p></body></html>","theSavedRoutesMenu":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>The saved routes menu is a new feature for Clew. It allows you to load previously traveled routes and navigate along them in either the forward or reverse direction.<h3>Loading a route</h3><p>The saved routes menu provides you with a list of previously recorded routes ordered from most to least recent. Once you tap on a route, you will be prompted to navigate the route in &quot;start to end&quot; or &quot;end to start&quot; mode. &quot;Start to end&quot; means that you would navigate along the route in the same direction as it was initially recorded. &quot;End to start&quot; means that you would navigate the route in the reverse direction as it was initially recorded. If either option is dimmed (i.e., not able to be activated), it means that an appropriate landmark was not created at either the start or end of the route.</p><h3>Deleting a saved route</h3><p>You can delete routes from this menu either swiping left (if not using VoiceOver) or by activating the secondary action on the route (if you are using VoiceOver).</p></body></html>","followingARoute":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>Once you activate the start navigation feature, the app will provide you with instructions to navigate back to your starting location. The app provides feedback in the following formats.</p><h3>Haptic feedback</h3><p>Assuming you have enabled haptic feedback in the app settings and you have an iPhone that supports haptics (iPhone 7 or later should work), the phone will provide haptic vibration when it is facing in the correct direction of travel for the route. It is important to keep in mind that this feedback is relative to the direction of the phone, rather than your body. When you achieve a milestone in the route (we call these waypoints), you will feel a stronger haptic vibration.</p><h3>Auditory beeps</h3><p>Assuming you have enabled sound feedback in the app settings and your iphone doesn't have system sounds muted, the phone will make a beeping sound when it is facing in the correct direction of travel for the route. It is important to keep in mind that this feedback is relative to the direction of the phone, rather than your body. When you achieve a milestone in the route (we call these waypoints), you will hear a different sound effect.</p></h3><h3>Speech feedback</h3<p>Assuming you have enabled speech feedback in the app settings and voice over is on, the phone will provide you with voice directions whenever you encounter a waypoint on your route, start a route, or complete a route. If you want to hear voice directions again, you can use the &quot;Get Directions&quot; button.</p></p></h3></body></html>","appSoundsAndTheirMeanings":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>In addition to the auditory guidance that you get when navigating along a route (described previously), there are some additional sounds that help you understand what is currently happening with the app. If you have enabled the speech feedback option in the app settings, each of these sounds is accompanied by speech that briefly explains the sounds meaning. Note that these sounds are not delivered when you are in the help menu (to avoid distracting you while you are reading through the help information).</p><ul><li><p>Normal motion tracking sound: this sound is a short recording of a brass instrument. It indicates that the app's position tracking has entered into the &quot;normal&quot; state. If the app has just started up this means that the motion tracking is now active. If the app previously experienced diminished accuracy, see next sound description, it means that the motion tracking has recovered. If you hear this sound after loading or resuming a route, this means that ARKit has been able to automatically align the route to the recording.</p></li><li><p>Motion tracking warning sound: this sound is a short recording of a stringed instrument playing a slightly scratchy note. This sound indicates that the app's position tracking has been degraded either due to the phone moving too rapidly or due to the environment not having an adequate amount of visual detail. The latter condition occurs if your environment is too dark or if the camera is occluded.</p></li></ul></body></html>","ratingYourNavigationExperience":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>Once you are done navigating, assuming you have enabled the &quot;Send Logs&quot; setting, the app will ask you to rate your service. These ratings help us improve the app experience and the app's accuracy. Along with your rating, your phone's path will be sent in the log. Please note that this data is not linked to you in any way and it does not contain any information about the location where the path was recorded (e.g., no GPS coordinates are logged). Further, no images or other sensitive information are logged by the app. If you have any concerns about the data in the logs, please contact us (or simply switch off the &quot;Send Logs&quot; feature in the app settings).</p></body></html>","providingFeedbackToTheDevelopmentTeam":"<html><head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no\"></head><body><p>Please send all feedback to the development team through the feedback popover in the Clew app. The feedback popover is accessible by tapping the feedback button in the app. We take your feedback seriously and will do our best to act on it.</p></body></html>"]
